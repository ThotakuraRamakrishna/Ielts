In the contemoparary era, there is a heated arguments over the issu that nations become more identical, because indivuales  bye products anywhere in the world. In my opinion, it has a lots benifits as well as some negative impacts on countries. The following paragrahs would highlight my personal perspective along with an epitome.

On the one hand, out of all arguments, on of my best poiny point of view that people are thinking more advanced in these days, so they are being sold products what they desired in their minds with out taking any time. which means technology have been developed over approximately 25 years so with help of online they have bye any items in country what they want. For instance, one of my friend recentally brought laptop from Australia, but he was living in india. I believe that not onlt get produts from other countries but also get their cultural habbit.


On the other hand, there are also some of the negatives for us. If we bye foreign countries produts, then we loose our cost more from our salary becauses in our nation same item has only 5000 rupees,but it is 8000 in other countries when as it compared it. To illustrates, some people have more knowledge about besides countries like the USA , China and Japap. However, other do not konw any thing about other nations.



In conclusion, i think that brought grosaries from besides nation, it has both the pros and the cons for us. so, it would be better to follow your mind what did it says too.
