I see eye to eye with central idea for various reasons. Out of all arguments, the strongest one to prove my view is that few people believes that entertainment is unnecessary for children; however, I think that if we want improve logical thinking, then we participate in  the entertainment activities, and also get pure mental health. For example, a recent study by the paries health group showed that 89% of students were active in their work place because of they were actively went to entertaiment shows in thier leisure time. Hence, it is conclusively clear that youngers are always intended to fun with others rather than spending whole time alone in a room.
