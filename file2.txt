The given process diagram illustrates the how drinking water is made using the solar power.

Overall, it can be seen that given diagram has approximately  6 stages and it is man made process. first stage starts at taking heat from sun then finally ends with water comes from a tap.

according to image, firstly, process start at solar controllers was taking heat by sun. After solar panels are heated generate electricity which is sent to pump or boring. Which is located in the under the earth, where water resources are available. Then machine starts it send water to water filter directly through the some of the pipes.

In the next step, drinking water is getting from the water filter where dirty water is purified into pure water.
