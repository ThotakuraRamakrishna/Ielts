On the one hand, out of all arguments, on of my best view is that it is better to construct modren rial way systems. What mean by these if we have new railway systems such as bullet trains, then it will gives us best services to us, and also we reach our destination speedly.In addition, after the gornvent would concentrate on thses, we defenitly get benefits from government services.
